Current level: I am an Azure Cloud Engineer with 3.6 years of experience
3 clear goals: 1) My Goal for the next 3 months is to learn devops theoratical as well as Practical. 
               2) To become job-ready for a DevOps engineer position.
               3) I want to stay dedicated and consistent in this course.
3 core DevOps skills: Kubernetes, infrastructure as code, Linux
Weekly time budget: I will try my best to allocate 2 to 3 hours on weekdays and 5 hours on Weekends.

DevOps is used for continuous integration and continuous development. To automate the repetitive task.
I want to Switch Job, and I want to switch in Devops field only.
To stay consistent, I will join all the live lectures (If not possible due to some reason, I will see the recordings that day itself) and will do all the assignments and will try to push myself to study Daily inspite of my current job.
This is my plan for 90days 

To stay motivated, to reward myself for small successes, to keep my goal in my mind, and push myself daily to study
